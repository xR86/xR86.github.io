# [Lens Filtering Experiment](https://xr86.github.io/experiments/lenses/)

Started originally in: [codepen.io/xR86/pen/XWmzbKb](https://codepen.io/xR86/pen/XWmzbKb)

## Motivation

Usually advanced filters on merchant sites suffice - you can get to a PC build in no time, all parts compatible - but for lenses they always seem to be lacking (reasons listed below).

As such you end up spending more money for lenses than you should, and while for most lenses they somewhat keep their value and you don't lose that much on resell (that is, if that lens is appreciated enough and/or out of production and highly sought for in order to be sold in general, or in your specific area), you are still taking too much of a risk and still get to lose money.

Some of the features that photography and/or general vendor websites miss:
+ filtering limited and/or absent
  + you can only pick checkbox ranges, not **actually input a range** - for aperture or focal distance this should be a must (note, there are zoom lenses with a fixed minimal aperture)
  + you usually **can't filter by lens engine**, which is an issue if you want a lens that is good for both photography and filming - you may want to minimize noise, choppy movement and focus breathing - all of the previous issues might lead to bad autofocus (you are filtering for AF lenses, but you might find that you're better off using MF for that specific lens/engine combination)
  + you **can't filter by lens elements count** ([the why factor](https://youtu.be/Cgve4QYR9D0?t=5m49s)), **lens construction type** (eg: aspherical)
  + you can't filter by weather-sealed lenses
  + you **can't filter by lens ranking scores** from well-known sites such as **[dxomark.com](https://www.dxomark.com/Lenses/)**
+ you **can't visualize how your composition would work** with that lens (unless you're [Ridley Scott](https://youtu.be/jqWocVDbahs?t=55), of course), for example **Nikon offered the [NIKKOR Lens Simulator](https://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/lens/simulator/)**
+ it's **hard to figure out** how the potential **lens you're looking at meshes with what you already have** (you'd like to keep a minimal set of lenses as much as possible to ensure portability for travel and maybe save some bucks, I hope)
  + beginner photographers or videographers might be interested in covering most of the common focal range (say, 10-300) with a couple of zoom and prime lenses, to discover what they prefer
  + more specialized photographers would have go-to focal ranges and/or specs and would be interested in better (sharpness, depth, less chromatic abberations, better AF) and faster (lower apertures) lenses
+ there are sometimes some **plain garbage lenses that you shouldn't even look at** (eg: compatibility issues, construction issues), and there are **lenses that you must get** (eg: the "nifty fifty", which for a Canon APS-C is Canon EF 50mm F1.8 STM)
+ (less important) cine lenses are usually in a different page
+ (less important) some lenses have more features (eg: Sigma lenses can be customized - [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcqZxPKC1vk), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYFmuughAwc))
